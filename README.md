## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Instructions

Write a Java program using inheritance(specifically abstract class) to simulate a library management system, where there are different types of library resources (e.g., books, magazines, DVDs), and each resource has its own unique features (e.g., author, publisher, release date).

The program should allow users to create and manage their library resources, check them in and out, and view their borrowing history, while also ensuring that each resource type follows its specific rules and regulations. 

Your grade will depend on how well you have written the program and implementation of the rules and regulations associated to Library.
